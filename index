            <h3>About Me: Leah Boulos</h3>
            <p>I am a dynamic future graduate of Dalhousie’s Master of Library and
                Information Studies Program. I come to the field with a background in music,
                having completed my Bachelor of Music <em>summa cum laude</em> from Mount Allison
                University in 2010. Upon entering the Dalhousie School of Information Management,
                I quickly began to develop interests in health sciences librarianship, research
                support services, and the management of information organisations. I was recently
                awarded the prestigious Dalhousie Horrocks National Leadership Award. </p>
            <p>Currently, I work as a student intern at the W.K. Kellogg Health Sciences Library
                on Dalhousie campus. This excellent introduction to health sciences librarianship
                has encouraged me to consider a career in the field. In particular, I am
                interested in the role of librarians as respected leaders in the health sciences
                research process. </p>
            <p>Outside of the classroom, I am Co-Chair of the Dalhousie Journal of
                Interdisciplinary Management, where I lead a team of students from all programs
                within the Faculty of Management in the production of an annual open access journal
                of graduate-level work. </p>
            <p>In my spare time, I perform with the <a href="http://www.xara.ca/" target="_blank">Xara Choral
                    Theatre Ensemble</a>, which was named the top women’s choir in Canada in 2013
                and was recently nominated for an East Coast Music Award. My other hobbies include
                cooking, cross stitching, and travelling. </p>
